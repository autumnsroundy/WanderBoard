**🗺️ WanderBoard**

WanderBoard is an interactive web application that lets users drop pins anywhere on a world map and attach “digital postcards” with titles, notes, and optional images.
All data is saved automatically using localStorage, creating a personal travel journal that persists across browser sessions.
This project was built for WDD II and demonstrates state management, multi-view UI design, map rendering, and interactive user input. This project was built over the course of approximately **30 hours**, focusing on interactive front-end functionality, client-side data persistence, and dynamic DOM manipulation.

**🌟 Features**
- Interactive world map built with Leaflet.js
- Drop pins by clicking anywhere on the map
- Pins save automatically to localStorage
- Persistent postcard data (title, notes, image)
- Postcard modal for creating/editing memories
- Image upload support with preview
- Gallery View showing all postcards in a responsive card layout
- Delete functionality for removing postcards and pins
- Navigation between Map and Gallery with active styling
- Warm, scrapbook-inspired theme + responsive layout

**🎯Purpose**

WanderBoard allows users to visually document places they’ve traveled by attaching memories directly to locations on a world map.
Instead of a standard photo album, users create a scrapbook-like travel journal that feels personal, interactive, and creative.

**This project demonstrates:**
- Multi-view, state-driven UI
- Persistent local browser storage / retrieval 
- Working with a map rendering library
- Modular JavaScript structure
- External API usage (Leaflet + OSM)
- Basic animations and styled components
- CSS-based UI animations and styling
- Optional work with third-party APIs

**👤 Target Audience**
- Travelers and adventurers
- Students who want a visual memory board
- Anyone who prefers creative journaling over plain photo storage
- Casual users who enjoy map-based interfaces
- The design aims to feel warm, friendly, and scrapbook-like—not corporate or sterile.


**🛠️ Tech Stack**
Libraries
- Leaflet.js – Map UI + events
- OpenStreetMap – Map tiles
- CSS transitions – Flip animations, fades, movement
Browser APIs
- localStorage – Persist postcard objects & pin positions
- URL.createObjectURL() – (Planned) Handle user image uploads


**🗃️ Data Storage**
WanderBoard uses the browser’s localStorage to save:
- Pin coordinates
- Associated postcard data (text, images)
- Map state (optional stretch)
- A .json export/import system will allow users to save or restore their memory board.

## JavaScript Implementations

- **Modular ES6 code** separated into:
  - `main.js` — Handles navigation between Map and Gallery views.  
  - `map.js` — Leaflet map initialization, pin rendering, and click events.  
  - `postcards.js` — Modal logic, saving postcards, image upload & compression, localStorage handling.  
  - `gallery.js` — Dynamically rendering gallery cards, open and delete functionality.  
- **Event handling:** Modal open/close, pin clicks, Save button, image upload.  
- **DOM manipulation:** Gallery and modal dynamically update based on stored data.  
- **Image handling:** Resizing and compressing images using `<canvas>` to prevent `QuotaExceededError`.  
- **Data persistence:** All postcards and pins serialized to localStorage for cross-session persistence.
